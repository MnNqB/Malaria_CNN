It was dubbed the \"single biggest killer of humans in history\" by the YouTube channel, 'Kurzgesagt - In a nutshell', who published a great video on its transmission and the ways scientists today are trying to fight it. However, before any treatment plan can be recommended the infection needs to identified and the condition diagnosed. This fact, combined with the disease’s severity and prevalence, means that an accurate, fast, and inexpensive detection method should be available to everyone and not just people from first world countries. \n\nThe CDC recognizes this, and recommends malaria be promptly treated to prevent further spread in the community as well as to prevent severe disease and potentially death for the patient. However, at the same time they highly discourage \"presumptive treatment\" (treatment without a confirmed diagnosis,) as overuse of antimalarial drugs may lead to drug-resistant strains as well as unwanted side effects for the patient.\n\nDiagnostic tests can be performed through either blood smear microscopy or PCR testing. PCR testing is more sensitive and specific than microscopy, but the testing is more expensive, and the results are not available as fast as microscopy. \n\nBecause of this, it is proposed that as part of a standard medical screening for populations in high-risk areas of malaria that a portion of blood drawn be devoted to an automated batch microscopy scanning by computer. Automating the task means testing could be implemented for large population sizes at little cost and only requiring minimal personnel with no more than technician level training. Outbreaks could be identified early, and human incurred disability could be minimized.\n\nThis could be implemented using machine learning and artificial neural networks. To show the feasibility, a model CNN will be trained using a small data set and only minimal computer resources. The dataset used in training the model contains images of blood cell slides with and without parasitic infection. Before real-world implementation, a larger dataset and additional training processor-hours would be required. However, even on this small scale the results prove promising. A well-trained model hosted in the cloud could potentially enable any cellphone with an internet connection to function as a malaria testing device.\n\n\nStained thin blood smear slides from 150 infected and 50 healthy patients were collected and photographed by the  Chittagong Medical College Hospital in Bangladesh.

CNN's scan over an image using a filter, usually 3x3 pixels, and determine how similar the current image scan area is to the filter. This helps them perform better at image recognition since they are looking at a region of NxN pixels, vs one pixel, so they can pick up on correlations in images. In contrast, if a regular neural net model were fit to an image, it would skip the feature extraction process, and just save the image inputs as a flattened layer using their pixel values as is. This would lead to loss of nearby pixel information, as well as make the input layer much larger (NxN).\n\n\n![CNN Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MnNqB/Malaria_CNN/main/CNN%20Architecture_MNB.PNG)\n\nThis model has three convolutional layers, each using rectified linear activation units (ReLU). The convolutional layer applies different filters to try and detect patterns, and outputs a feature map (dot product). The ReLU activation returns only positive values while setting any negative dot products to zero. ReLU activations are widely used because they are more computationally efficient and show better convergence performance than other activation functions, such as the sigmoid function. Each convolutional layer's output is fed into a pooling layer. Next, a Max Pooling layer is applied, which only keeps the maximum output from each quarter of the feature map. This reduced output is fed into the next layer, and eventually to the dense layer.\n\nTo demonstrate a simple image and filter convolution, see CNN hand calculation below. A random filter is selected and applied using a dot product to the picture. A bias term is added, and the final value is added to the feature map. The process is started over after making the appropriate stride. In this model the stride is set to the default of 1.\n\n![CNN hand calc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MnNqB/Malaria_CNN/main/CNN%20Example1.gif)\n\nThis makes it easy to see how information from a large picture can be compressed down using CNNs. A regular neural net would have fed all 36 pixels to the dense layer, whereas this approach only feeds just 4. Real images are sized a lot more than 6x6, so CNN’s scale much better for real images.\n\nOnce the image and filter dot product is calculated, a bias term is added. Once this is done across the whole image the feature map is done. Next, the ReLU activation is applied which sets any negative numbers to zero. Finally, max pooling is applied followed by the flattening layer, which outputs all values into one column (vector). This is what gets fed into the Dense (neural net) layer. \n\n\n![CNN Hand Calc2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MnNqB/Malaria_CNN/main/CNN%20Example2.gif)\n\n\nFor more information please check out
